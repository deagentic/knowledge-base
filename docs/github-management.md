# GitHub Management & CI/CD

## Permissions

- **Organization Owners**: Have full access to all repositories.
- **Agents**: Should act with the permissions of the user operating them.
- **Skills Repo**: Publicly readable (sharing skills), writes restricted to maintain quality.

## GitHub Actions

We aim to use standard actions for:

1. **Linting**: Automating code quality checks.
2. **Sync Verification**: (Future) ensuring the `Skills` match the implementation.

## Project Management

- Use GitHub Projects for tracking tasks across repositories.
- Milestones should be used for major initiatives (e.g., "Q1 Onboarding Update").
