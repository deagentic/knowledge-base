## For AI Agents

Read the docs in this exact order to build full context before writing any code:

1. **[mission.md](docs/mission.md)** — Understand the 4 pipelines and the "why" behind every project.
2. **[dev-guide.md](docs/dev-guide.md)** — Learn the BDD-first workflow, typing rules, and testing expectations.
3. **[git-strategy.md](docs/git-strategy.md)** — Know how to branch, commit, and open PRs.
4. **[github-management.md](docs/github-management.md)** — Understand how issues and milestones drive delivery.
5. **[cookiecutter-standards.md](docs/cookiecutter-standards.md)** — Follow the standard project structure when scaffolding.

After reading all five, you have the full operating context for the organization.
